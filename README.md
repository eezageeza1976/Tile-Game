# Tile-Game
Tile based game using Tiled and pytmx

This is a short 2 level tile based, top-down game, using the Tiled Map Editor to create maps and loading into pygame using PyTMX.

The game is based on the KidsCanCode tutorials for creating a tiled game.

I take no credit in designing the game, all the code has been built up using the tutorials on the KidsCanCode website and using free art packs from Kenney.nl website. The only credit I can take is designing my own maps and I have also added a "Next Level" section in the code which isn't in the tutorials.
